<p>The 100 (Continue) status code indicates that the initial part of a request has been
received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final
response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.</p>

<p>When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a 100-continue expectation,
the 100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body, as
described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1</a>. The client ought to continue
sending the request and discard the 100 response.</p>

<p>If the request did not contain an Expect header field containg the 100-continue
expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.</p>

<p>The 101 (Switching Protocols) status code indicates that the server understands and is
willing to comply with the client&#39;s request, via, the Upgrade header field
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.7">Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]</a>, for a change 
in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server MUST generate an 
Upgrade header field in the response that indicates which protocol(s) will be switched to
immediatly after the empty line that terminates the 101 response.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when it is adventageous
to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP might be adventageous over
older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be adventageous
when delivering resources that use such features.</p>
</div></td></tr><tr><td id='variant.Ok'><a class='stability Unmarked' title='No stability level'></a><code>Ok</code></td><td><div class='docblock'><p>200 - OK (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.1">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.1</a>)</p>

<p>The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The payload sent in a
200 response depends on the request method. For the methods defined by this specification,
the intended meaning of the payload can be summarized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>GET - a representation of the target resource;</li>
<li>HEAD - the same representation as GET, but without the representation data;</li>
<li>POST - a representation of the status of, or results obtained from, the action;</li>
<li>PUT, DELETE - a representation of the status of the action;</li>
<li>OPTIONS - a representation of the communications options;</li>
<li>TRACE - a representation of the request message as received by the end server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload, though an origin
server MAY generate a payload body of zero length. If no payload is desired, an origin
server ought to send 204 (No Content) instead. For CONNECT, no payload is allowed because
the successful result is a tunnelm, which begins immediatly after the 200 response header
section.</p>

<p>A 200 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls
(see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>

<p>The 201 (Created) status code indicates that the request has been fufilled and has resulted
in one or more new resources being created. The primary resource created by the request is
identified by either a Location header field in the response or, if no Location field is
received, by the effective request URI.</p>

<p>The 201 response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s) created.
See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.2">Section 7.2 of [RFC7231]</a> for a
discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as ETag and
Last-Modified, in a 201 response.</p>

<p>The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been accepted for processing,
but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be
acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no
facility in HTTP for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation.</p>

<p>The 202 response is intentionally noncommittal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept
a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once
per day) without requiring that the user agent&#39;s connection to the server persist until the
process is completed. The representation sent with this response ought to describe the
request&#39;s current status and point to (or embed) a status monitor that can provide the user
with an estimate of when the request will be fufilled.</p>
</div></td></tr><tr><td id='variant.NonAuthoritativeInformation'><a class='stability Unmarked' title='No stability level'></a><code>NonAuthoritativeInformation</code></td><td><div class='docblock'><p>203 - Non-Authoritative Information (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.4">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.4</a>)</p>

<p>The 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) status code indicates that the request was
successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that of the origin server&#39;s
200 (OK) response by a transforming proxy
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.7.2">Section 5.7.2 of [RFC7230]</a>).
This status code allows the proxy to notify the recipients when a transformation has been
applied, since that knowledge might impact later decisions regarding the content. For
example, future cache validation requests for the conent might only be applicable along the
same request path (through the same proxies).</p>

<p>The 203 response is similiar to the Warning code of 214 Transformation Applied
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.5">Section 5.5 of [RFC7234]</a>), which has
the advantage of being appliable to responses with any status code.</p>

<p>A 203 resposne is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls (see
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>
</div></td></tr><tr><td id='variant.NoContent'><a class='stability Unmarked' title='No stability level'></a><code>NoContent</code></td><td><div class='docblock'><p>204 - No Content (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.5">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.5</a>)</p>

<p>The 204 (No Content) status code indicates that the server has successfully fufilled the
request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.
Metadata in the response header fields refer to the target resource and its selected
representation after the requested action was applied.</p>

<p>For example, if a 204 status code is received in response to a PUT request and the response
contains the ETag header field, then the PUT was successful and the ETag field-value
contains the entity-tag for the new representation of that target resource.</p>

<p>The 204 response allows a server to indicate that the action has been successfully applied
to the target resource, which implying that the user agent does not need to traverse away
from its current &quot;document view&quot; (if any). The server assumes that the user agent will
provide some indication of the success to its user, in accord with its own interface, and
apply any new or updated metadata in the response to its active representation.</p>

<p>For example, a 204 status code is commonly used with document editing interfaces
corresponding to a &quot;save&quot; action, such that the doucment being saved remains available to
the user for editing. It is also frequently used with interfaces that expect automated data
transfers to be prevalent, such as withing distributed version control systems.</p>

<p>A 204 response is terminated by the first empty line after the header fiels because it
cannot contain a message body.</p>

<p>A 204 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls (see
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>

<p>The 205 (Reset Content) status code indicates that the server has fufilled the request and
desires that the user agent reset the &quot;document view&quot;, which caused the request to be sent,
to its original state as received from the origin server.</p>

<p>This response is intended to support a common data entry use case where the user receives
content that supports data entry (a form, notepad, canvas, etc.), enters or manipulates
data in that space, causes the entered data to be submitted in a request, and then the data
entry mechanism is reset for the next entry so that the user can easily initiate another
input aciton.</p>

<p>Since the 205 status code implies that no addtional content will be provided, a server MUST
NOT generate a payload in a 205 response. In other wors, a server MUST do one of the
following for a 205 response: a) indicate a zero-length body for the response by including
a Content-Length header field with a value of 0; b) indicate a zero-length payload for the
response by including a Transfer-Encoding header field with a value of chunked and a message
body consiting of a single chunk of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediatly
after sending the blank line terminating the header section.</p>

<p>The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the target resource has more than one
representation, each with its own more specific identifier, and information about
alternatives is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred
representation by redirecting its request to one or more of those identifiers. In other
words, the server desires that the user agent engage in reactive negotiation to select the
most appropriate representation(s) for its needs
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4">Section 3.4 of [RFC7231]</a>).</p>

<p>If the server has a preferred choice, the server SHOULD generate a Location header field
containing a preferred choice&#39;s URI reference. The user agent MAY use the Location field
value for automatic redirection.</p>

<p>For request methods other than HEAD, the server SHOULD generate a payload in the 300
response containing a list of representation metadata and URI reference(s) from which the
user or user agent can choose the one most preferred. The user agent MAY make a selection
from that list automatically if it understands the provided media type. A specific format
for automatic selection is not defined by this specification because HTTP tries to remain
orthogonal to the definition of its payloads. In practice, the representation is provided
in some easily parsed format believed to be acceptable to the user agent, as determined by
shared design or content negotiation, or in some commonly accepted hypertext format.</p>

<p>A 300 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls
(see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4..2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: The original proposal for the 300 status code defined the URI header field as
providing a list of alternative representations, such that it would be usable for 200,
300, and 406 responses and be transferred in response to the HEAD method. However, a
lack of deployment and disagreement over syntax led to both URI and Alternates (a
subsequent proposal) being dropped from this specification. It is possible to
communicate the list using a set of Link header fields
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988"> [RFC5988] </a>, each with a relationship of
&quot;alternate&quot;, though deployment is a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>

<p>The 301 (Moved Permanently) status code indicates that the target resource has been
assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of
the enclosed URIs. Clients with link-editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link
references to the effective request URI to one or more of the new references sent by the
server, where possible.</p>

<p>The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a preferred
URI reference for the new permanent URI. The user agent MAY use the location field value
for automatic redirection. The server&#39;s response payload usually contains a short hypertext
note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method from POST to GET
for the subsequent request. If this behavior is undesired the 307 (Temporary Redirect)
status code can be used instead.</p>

<p>A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method

<p>The 302 (Found) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a
different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to
continue to use the effective request URI for future requests.</p>

<p>The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a URI
reference for the different URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field value for
automatic redirection. The server&#39;s response payload usually contains a short hypertext
note with a hyperlink to the different URI(s).</p>

<p>The 303 (See Other) status code indicates that the server is redirecting the user agent to
a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header field, which is
intended to provide an idrect response to the original request. A user agent can perform a
retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which might
also be redirected, and present the eventual result as an answer to the original request. 
Note that the new URI in the Location header field is not equivalent to the effective 
request URI.</p>

<p>This status code is applicable to any HTTP method. It is primarily used to allow the output
of a POST action redirect the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the
information corresponding to the POST response in a form that can be separately identified
bookmakred, and cached, independent of the original request.</p>

<p>A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does not have a 
representation of the target resource that can be transferred by the server over HTTP. 
However, the Location field value refers to a resource taht is descriptive of the target
resource, such that making a retrieval request on that other resource might result in a 
representation that is useful to recipients without implying that it represents the original
target resource. Note that answers to the question of what can be represented, what 
representations are adequate, and what might be a useful description are outside the scope 
of HTTP.</p>

<p>Except for respones to a HEAD request, the representation of a 303 response ought to contain
a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the same URI reference provided in the Location
header field.</p>

<p>The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource resides 
temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method
if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI. Since the redirection can change over
time, the client ought to continue using the original effective request URI for future 
requests.</p>

reference for the different URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field value for 
automatic redirection. The server&#39;s response payload usually contains a short hypertext note

<p>The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses
to authorize it. A servier that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can
describe that reason in the response payload (if any).</p>

<p>If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server considers them 
insufficient to grant access. The client SHOULD NOT automatically repate the request with
the same credentials. The client MAY repeat the request with new or different credentials.
However, a request might be forbidden for reasons unrelated to credentials.</p>

<p>The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a current
representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists. A 
404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the origin knows, presumably
through some configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.</p>

<p>The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in the 
request-line is known by teh origin server but not supported by the target resource. The
origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the
target resource&#39;s currently supported methods.</p>

<p>A 405 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls (see

<p>The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource does not have a
current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the 
proactive negotiation header fields received in the request 
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of [RFC7231]</a>), and the 
server is unwilling to supply a default representation.</p>

<p>The server SHOULD generate a payload containing a list of available representation 
characteristics and corresponding resource identifiers from which the user or agent can
choose the one most appropriate. A user agent MAY automatically select the most appropriate
choice from that list. However, this specification does not define any standard for such 
automatic selection, as described in

<p>The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not receive a complete
request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.  A server SHOULD send the
&quot;close&quot; connection option 
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.1">Section 6.1 of [RFC7230]</a>) in the 
response, since 408 implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than
continue waiting.  If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the client MAY 
repeat that request on a new connection. </p>

<p>The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be completed due to 
a conflict with the current state of teh target resource. This code is used in situations
where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The server 
SHOULD generate a payload that includes enough information for a user to recognize the 
source of the conflict.</p>

<p>Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example if versioning
were being used and the representation being PUT included changes to a resource that
conflict with those mad by an earlier (third-party) request, the origin server might use a
409 response to indicate that it can&#39;t complete the request. In this case, the response 
representation would likely contain information useful for merging the differences based on
the revision history.</p>

<p>The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource is no longer
available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent. If the
origin server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition
is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used instead.</p>

<p>The 410 resposne is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying 
the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners 
desire that remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for 
limited-time, promotional, services and resources belonging to individuals no longer
associated with the origin server&#39;s site. It is not necessary to mark all permmanently 
unavailable resources as &quot;gone&quot; or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left
to the discretion of the server owner.</p>

<p>A 410 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
definition or explicit cache controls (see

<p>The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to accept the 
request without a defined Content-Length 
(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2">Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]</a>). The

<p>The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing to process a
request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.</p>

<p>If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header field to

<p>The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to service the
request because the request-target 
([Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]])(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3)">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3)</a>) is 
longer thant the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only likely to
occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
information, when the client has descended into a &quot;black hole&quot; of redirection (e.g., a 
redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack
by a client attempting to exploit potentital security holes.</p>

<p>A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method

<p>The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin server is refusing
to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on
the target resource. The format problem might be due to the request&#39;s indicated Content-Type
or Cotnent-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.</p>

<p>The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to perform the
request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades
to a different protocol. The server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to
indicate the required protocol(s)

<p>The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates that the server does not support,
or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that was used in the request message. The 
server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same 
major version as the client, as described in 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.6">Section 2.6 of [RFC7230]</a>, other than
